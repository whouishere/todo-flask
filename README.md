# To Do
To Do web app project made with Flask.

## Why?
For pure fun and practice! I very much know that we don't need another useless To Do project.

It's still very ugly and broken, with additional features planned.

## To Do (pun intended): 
- Edit and delete task button
- Find items through its UUIDs
- Different levels of priority, with different colors
- Different user profiles that can have different lists
- Settings page where you can change appearance and stuff (dark mode?) and keep it as cookies or for the user account
- Store user data as JSON

## Run
First create a virtual environment, and activate it.
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Now install project dependencies.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And finally run the `run.py` script!
```
./run.py
```
Check out its extra options with `./run.py --help`.
