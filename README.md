# To Do
To Do web app project made with Flask.

## Why?
For pure fun and practice! I very much know that we don't need another useless To Do project.

Besides, it's still very ugly and broken (unchecking tasks does not work lol), barely an MVP.

## To Do (pun intended): 
- Different user profiles that can have different lists
- Settings page where you can change appearance and stuff (dark mode?) and keep it as cookies or for the user account
- Use SQLite or something even lighter

## Run
First create a virtual environment, and activate it.
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Now install project dependencies.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And finally run the `run.py` script!
```
./run.py
```
Check out its extra options with `./run.py --help`.
